# Wordle

It's fun, simple and, like a crossword.

## Getting Started

Wordle gives players six chances to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. As shown above, if you have the right letter in the right spot, it shows up green. A correct letter in the wrong spot shows up yellow. A letter that isn't in the word in any spot.
<br>
You can enter a total of six words, meaning you can enter five burner words from which you can learn hints about the letters and their placements. Then you get one chance to put those hints to use. Or you can try for performance and guess the word of the day in three, two or even one go.
<br>
You will be given six attempts first, The number of attempts keep on reducing while leveling up. You have to solve the Puzzle within given attempts respectively.
